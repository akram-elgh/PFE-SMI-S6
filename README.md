# Abstract

Today's world is witnessing tremendous progress in various fields, particularly in the field of information technology, which has made things much more accessible in all aspects of life. Information systems have become essential for meeting the needs of any organization and have greatly facilitated tasks for both businesses and individuals.
Language centers play a crucial role in providing language learning and educational services to students of different ages and backgrounds. As language center management becomes increasingly complex, there is a growing need for efficient and effective systems to streamline operations and enhance the learning experience.
In the context of our final year project, I have undertaken the development of a website and web application for the management of a language center. The goal of this web-based application is to design an information system that simplifies and improves the process of managing student registrations, course schedules, teacher assignments, and other administrative tasks.
Our objective is to design and develop a user-friendly interface that enables the staff to easily manage students, teachers, classes, and track payment status.

# Project Structure

The project is structured into two folder : 
  - **website** : This folder contains the implementation of the website used to showcase informations about the center and offers online registration for students. Link : https://akram-elgh.github.io/PFE-website
  - **app** : This folder contains the implementation of the web app that the administrators use to manage the center.
